# El Leiva Portfolio

## Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JS (vanilla)
- Audio embedding (HTML5 audio)
- Images / GIFs / Video embeds
- Anchor linking for projects

## Purpose / Motivation
This portfolio showcases my work in:
- Game development
- Narrative & storytelling
- Art & comic panels
- Audio / OST
- Tools & utilities

I built a **modular structure** where each project links to all its assets via a central projects hub and section IDs. No navbar is required; everything is anchor-linked.

## How to Use
- Click on any project in `projects.html` to jump to its narrative, art, audio, or tools.
- Each project section is anchor-linked across pages for easy navigation.
