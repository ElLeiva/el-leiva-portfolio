  <h1>About</h1>

  <!-- FOCUS -->
  <p>
    I make games that evoke emotion through simple mechanics and a strong,
    cohesive atmosphere.
  </p>

  <!-- MICRO ORIGIN -->
  <p>
    I come from a self-directed background, learning game development alongside
    art, music, and programming, and gradually shaping my work through small,
    finished projects.
  </p>

  <!-- PROCESS -->
  <p>
    My workflow is built around rapid prototyping, testing ideas early, and
    polishing only once a concept proves itself. I value iteration over
    perfection and execution over theory.
  </p>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <p>
    This approach allows me to focus on clarity, mood, and player experience,
    ensuring that every system supports the intended feeling of the game.
